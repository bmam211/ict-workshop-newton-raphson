Welcome to the physics-informed unsupervised learning approach

To reproduce the results in our paper/technical report, follow the steps below.

1, Install the same environment as already indicated in the RL (Reinforcement Learning) approach in the root directory of this Github repository.

2, Download the entire folder named "Physics-informed unsupervised learning approach" in the root directory of this Github repository.

3, In the downloaded folder you will find a numpy array file named "vector_data.npy". This is the training dataset. This data file is the same one as the "vector_data.npy" in the folder "grid_dataset" in the root directory of this Github repository.

4, Enter the downloaded folder and open the script "PINN_unsupervised_learning_approach.py"
